TODO:
  - LAN hosting (https://github.com/cxong/ENetLANChatServer.git)
  - Game UI: 
    - Server screen
      - hosting (lan, localhost)
      - joining (list all servers)
    - Waiting for game to start screen

  - Variable sized packets instead of hard coded 256 bytes (lots of wasted bytes rn)
  - Animations and player states
  - Gameplay

Okay so plan:
  1) Server upgrade:
      Better packets
      LAN hosting and joining
  2) Game upgrade:
      Server selection
      Probably hosting from inside the game executable (NEED TO DO FORKS MAYBE) (UNLESS I JUST REWRITE THE SERVER TO LIKE NOT DO ENET INIT AND MAKE THE "CLIENT" UPDATE THE SERVER)
  3) Game mechanics:
      Player state machine
      Yknow like fighting in the fighting game
  4) Server upgrade more:
      Custom number of players
      Maybe like a cryptographical handshake or whatever
      Just like make it a real server thing
